From Jumpstart Labs Tutorial:

## Process

This is a hybrid guided tutorial and independent work project. The text will walk you through the step-by-step process of building the fundamental functionality. Then the tutorial ends with a list of possible extensions. You should choose and implement several of these extensions to practice and refine the learnings from the tutorial.

## Learning Goals

After completing this tutorial you should be able to:

- lay out a Sinatra application
- define routes/endpoints for that application
- use view templates to render HTML
- store data across requests with YAML::Store
- write a simple HTML form
- read and react to HTTP parameters from the form
- explain the statelessness of the HTTP request/response cycle

## Still To-Do

- standardize styles and rework to fit html/css best practices
